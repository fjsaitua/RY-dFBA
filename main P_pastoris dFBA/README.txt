P_pastoris dFBA is a version of the RY-dFBA platform developed by Benjamín Sánchez designed to understand and ultimately improve dynamic cultivations of the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.

It is divided into three sections, whose functions are detailed below:

- Batch mode: 
	- Calibration of bioreactor dynamics in batch mode.
	- Reparametrization of the initial batch model structure
	- Propose an a priori robust modeling structure for this type of cultivations

- Fed-batch mode:
	- Same functions as the ones detailed in the batch version of the model

- Simulation: 
	- Determination of flux distributions throughout cultivations
	- Determiantion of knock-out candidates to improve recombinant protein production
	- Analysis of feeding strategies to improve recombinant protein productivity
